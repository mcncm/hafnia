% A custom command for a target symbol *without* a left-facing \qw. This will
% only be available in the standalone class, because it has to be included in
% the header. It might also be *fragile*, and stop working when quantikz
% eventually updates. For the sake of attribution, here is the preamble of the
% quantikz source file I modified this from.

%This is the quantikz library for typesetting quantum circuits using LaTeX/Tikz. version 0.9.6
