This is the compiler for a little quantum programming language that I designed for my Master's thesis. It's no longer maintained, because I think the ideas in here are no longer state-of-the-art (the recent (2025) [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3704842](Qurts) paper basically put these ideas into the literature. Oops! Shoulda published. Good for the Edinburgh team, though :)), and because I've moved on to bigger and better things.

Since I'm not really doing anything with this code any more, I'm not going to keep the README up to date, or document much of anything outside of what's in the thesis, but I want to leave it here as a code sample for future employers and whatnot, since it's a reasonably ambitious project from before LLMs took off, and because I admit I'm actually a little proud of it.

You can find the thesis [https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/140068](here), which is pretty funny. It's basically an "I wrote a program!" thesis. I had this idea during covid, before I even really knew that PL theory was a real field, and basically no supervision on it, and I just ran with it. You can see the ways in which I didn't know what I was doing, the wheels I was reinventing, how over-ambitious I was being, and also the ways in which some kind of clever ideas shone through.
