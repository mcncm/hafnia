"""This little Python script provides some very primitive circuit simulation
utilities in pure numpy. We could instead write these tests in Rust, using a
suitable linear algebra library, but I'd rather use a lightweight scripting
language for the time being. It's perhaps a little bit regrettable to depend on
Python and Numpy, but it will do for now.

We could also rely on a fit-for-purpose dependency such as `qutip` or `qiskit`,
but there are a few reasons to avoid this: first, I don't know how much I can
trust the stability of these packages, however nice they appear; second, other
developers might find them difficult to use or install, but can be almost
assumed to have numpy already on their system; finally, I don't want to show
"favoritism" to one or another circuit simulation package.

Anyway, rest assured that this is not supposed to be fast or sophisticated.
Also, the first bit really should be a module separate from the script bit.
Despite the simplicity of this thing, I admit it's cribbed (though not verbatim)
from this (this nice blog post)[http://kattemolle.com/other/QCinPY.html] by
Joris KattemÃ¶lle. Go ahead, revoke my programming license.
